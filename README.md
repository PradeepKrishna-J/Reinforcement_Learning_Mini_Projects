## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install gymnasium numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

### Running the Projects
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open any `.ipynb` file to explore the implementation

## 📖 Learning Path

**Recommended order for beginners:**
1. Start with `Markov_process.ipynb` for theoretical foundations
2. Explore `value_iteration_and_policy_iteration_algorithms.ipynb`
3. Try simpler environments: `frozen_lake.ipynb`
4. Progress to more complex problems: `Jacks'_Car_Rental_*.ipynb`
5. Experiment with different algorithms on the same environment
